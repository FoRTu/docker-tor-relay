# Docker Tor-Relay
An Docker image of a Tor-Relay based on the latest stable-slim Debian image.

You can build it by [Dockerfile](https://github.com/FoRTu/docker-tor-relay/blob/master/Dockerfile) or just download from Docker Hub [https://hub.docker.com/r/fortu/tor-relay](https://hub.docker.com/r/fortu/tor-relay).

I created it for being used on [unRAID](https://unraid.net/) systems, but you know, Docker can be run on any GNU/Linux.

Here you are a [torrc](https://github.com/FoRTu/docker-tor-relay/blob/master/torrc) configuration file for the Tor-Relay. You can be used as a template as it is fully functional.
